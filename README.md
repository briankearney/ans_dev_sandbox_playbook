Ansible Playbook Sandbox

## Overview

An Ansible playbook sandbox that demonstrates running a GitHub-hosted role locally against `localhost`.

This repository is intentionally small and aims to provide a convenience environment for developing and testing the
`briankearney/ans_dev_sandbox_role` role.

**Quick Overview**
- **Playbook:** `playbooks/sample_playbook.yml`
- **Inventory:** `inventory/main.yml` (defines a `local` group with `localhost`)
- **Role requirements:** `roles/requirements.yml` (used by `ansible-galaxy` to fetch the role into `./roles`)
- **Helper scripts:** `ACTIVATE_SANDBOX_ENV.bash`, `RUN_PLAYBOOK.bash`, `DECRYPT_VAULTED_ITEMS.py`

## Design Philosophy

**Why No `ansible.cfg`?**

This repository intentionally does **not** include an `ansible.cfg` file. In enterprise environments (Fortune 100 companies, government agencies, etc.), configuration files like `ansible.cfg` are often prohibited by security policies due to concerns about:
- Unauthorized configuration changes
- Security policy bypasses
- Audit trail gaps
- Configuration drift across teams

**Environment Variable Approach**

Instead, this repository uses **environment variables** set by `ACTIVATE_SANDBOX_ENV.bash` to configure Ansible behavior:

```bash
export ANSIBLE_ROLES_PATH=roles
export ANSIBLE_FILTER_PLUGINS=plugins
export ANSIBLE_LIBRARY=library
export ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE="$PLAYBOOK_PATH/vault-pw.txt"
# ... and more
```

This approach provides:
- ✅ **Enterprise compatibility** - Works in environments that prohibit `ansible.cfg`
- ✅ **Explicit configuration** - All settings visible in one script
- ✅ **Session isolation** - Settings only apply to the current shell session
- ✅ **Easy auditing** - Configuration changes tracked in version control
- ✅ **No side effects** - Doesn't modify global Ansible behavior

**Note:** The `.gitignore` file explicitly excludes `ansible.cfg` to prevent accidental commits that could cause issues in enterprise environments.

**Prerequisites**
- Ansible (recommended 2.9+ or a recent 2.14+ depending on your environment)
- Python virtual environment (optional but recommended)
- Python dependencies (see `requirements.txt`)

Quickstart (from repository root):

```bash
# Activate the sandbox environment using the helper script
source ACTIVATE_SANDBOX_ENV.bash

# Install the role into ./roles using the requirements file
ansible-galaxy install -r roles/requirements.yml --roles-path ./roles

# Run the sample playbook against the sample inventory
ansible-playbook -i inventory/main.yml playbooks/sample_playbook.yml
```

Alternate helper (wrapper):

```bash
# Make the wrapper executable then run it
chmod +x RUN_PLAYBOOK.bash
./RUN_PLAYBOOK.bash
```

**Python Dependencies:**

All Python dependencies are defined in `requirements.txt`. The `ACTIVATE_SANDBOX_ENV.bash` script automatically creates a virtual environment and installs these dependencies. You can also install them manually:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Testing:

This repository includes comprehensive unit tests for both helper scripts and Python utilities to ensure reliability. The tests are located in the `tests/` directory and run automatically via GitHub Actions on every push and pull request.

**Automated CI/CD:**
- All unit tests run automatically via GitHub Actions (see badges above)
- Matrix testing across Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
- Test results visible in the [Actions tab](https://github.com/briankearney/ans_dev_sandbox_playbook/actions)

**Bash Script Tests:**

```bash
# Run unit tests for ACTIVATE_SANDBOX_ENV.bash
bash tests/test_activate_sandbox_env.bash

# Run unit tests for RUN_PLAYBOOK.bash
bash tests/test_run_playbook.bash
```

**Python Unit Tests:**

```bash
# Run unit tests for DECRYPT_VAULTED_ITEMS.py
python3 -m unittest test_DECRYPT_VAULTED_ITEMS.py

# Run with verbose output
python3 -m unittest -v test_DECRYPT_VAULTED_ITEMS.py
```

The tests verify:
- **Bash Scripts**:
  - **Python Version Selection**: Ensures the script correctly identifies and selects the newest Python version less than 3.14
  - **Directory Resolution**: Verifies that the script correctly resolves its own directory, even when sourced from other locations
  - **Playbook Execution**: Tests the playbook runner wrapper functionality

- **Python Utilities** (`DECRYPT_VAULTED_ITEMS.py`):
  - **Vault Content Extraction**: Tests extraction of vault content from YAML files with proper error handling
  - **Vault Decryption**: Mocks ansible-vault decryption for both success and failure scenarios
  - **Base64 Decoding**: Tests base64 decoding functionality with various input types
  - **Output Formatting**: Tests YAML output with and without syntax highlighting

**Molecule Tests (Ansible Playbook Testing):**

This repository includes comprehensive Molecule testing infrastructure for validating the Ansible playbook and role. Molecule tests are located in the `molecule/` directory.

```bash
# Activate sandbox environment
source ACTIVATE_SANDBOX_ENV.bash

# Run all Molecule tests (default scenario)
molecule test

# Run specific scenarios
molecule test -s localhost-only    # Test localhost connection
molecule test -s with-linting      # Test with ansible-lint and yamllint

# Run linting separately
yamllint .
ansible-lint playbooks/ molecule/
```

**Molecule Test Scenarios:**
- **default**: Full test sequence with idempotence checking
- **localhost-only**: Validates localhost connection configuration
- **with-linting**: Includes ansible-lint and yamllint validation

**CI/CD Integration:**
- GitHub Actions workflow runs all Molecule scenarios on push/PR
- Matrix testing across Python 3.10, 3.11, and 3.12
- Automated linting validation

For detailed Molecule testing documentation, see [`molecule/README.md`](molecule/README.md).

For detailed test documentation, see [`tests/README.md`](tests/README.md).

Notes
- If this repository uses vaulted variables, use `DECRYPT_VAULTED_ITEMS.py` to assist with decryption workflows (see the script for usage).
- You can edit example variables in `defaults/main.yml` or in the `vars:` block of `playbooks/sample_playbook.yml`.

Files and directories
- `defaults/` : playbook default variables
- `inventory/` : sample inventory used by the playbook
- `playbooks/` : sample playbooks that call the role
- `roles/requirements.yml` : role source for `ansible-galaxy`
- `molecule/` : Molecule test scenarios for playbook validation
- `tests/` : unit tests for helper scripts


If you want, I can also add README files inside each subdirectory explaining their purpose and showing examples.
