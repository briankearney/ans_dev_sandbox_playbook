# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### `molecule verify` fails with argparse.ArgumentError

**Error Message:**
```
argparse.ArgumentError: argument --inventory/--ansible-inventory: conflicting option string: --ansible-inventory
ERROR    Verifier tests failed
```

**Cause:**
The `pytest-ansible` and `pytest-testinfra` plugins both register the same command-line argument (`--inventory` / `--ansible-inventory`), causing a conflict during pytest initialization. This affects Python 3.12+ due to stricter argparse validation.

**Solution:**
The activation script (`ACTIVATE_SANDBOX_ENV.bash`) automatically uninstalls `pytest-ansible` after installing dependencies. This is the recommended approach since:
- We only need `pytest-testinfra` for Molecule verify steps
- The `pytest-ansible` plugin is not used in our test scenarios
- Removing it has no impact on other Ansible functionality

**Manual Fix:**
If you encounter this error:
```bash
pip uninstall -y pytest-ansible
```

**Prevention:**
Always use `source ACTIVATE_SANDBOX_ENV.bash` to set up your environment. The script handles this automatically.

### Python Version Issues

**Issue:** Virtual environment created with Python 3.13 or higher

**Solution:**
The project supports Python >3.9 and <3.15 due to historical pytest plugin conflicts mitigated by our environment setup. The activation script automatically selects the newest compatible version available on your system. If you need to recreate your environment:

```bash
deactivate
rm -rf .venv
source ACTIVATE_SANDBOX_ENV.bash
```

The script will automatically choose the best available Python version (typically 3.10–3.14).

### Container Port Conflicts

**Error:** Port 2222 already in use when running `RUN_PLAYBOOK.bash`

**Solution:**
Edit `RUN_PLAYBOOK.bash` and modify the `CONTAINER_HOST_PORT` variable to use a different port:

```bash
CONTAINER_HOST_PORT=2223  # or any available port
```

### Molecule Config Warnings

**Warning:**
```
WARNING  default ➜ config: The scenario config file has been modified since the scenario was created
```

**Solution:**
This warning appears when the molecule.yml file changes after creating a scenario. To clear it:

```bash
molecule destroy -s default  # Clean up scenario
# or
molecule reset -s default    # Reset configuration without destroying instances
```

### Vault Decryption Failures

**Issue:** Cannot decrypt vaulted variables

**Checklist:**
1. Verify vault password file exists: `ls -la vault-pw.txt`
2. Check vault-id matches in the vaulted block (e.g., `vault_id: !vault |`)
3. Ensure `ANSIBLE_VAULT_PASSWORD_FILE` is set (automatically done by activation script)
4. Use the decrypt utility: `python DECRYPT_VAULTED_ITEMS.py --file vars/file.yml --vault-id dev`

### Missing Collections

**Error:** Collection not found during playbook execution

**Solution:**
Install required collections:
```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.txt  # If collections are in requirements.txt
# or
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.posix community.general
```

These are automatically installed by `RUN_PLAYBOOK.bash` but may be needed for manual playbook runs.

### Role Not Found

**Error:** Role 'ans_dev_sandbox_role' not found

**Solution:**
Install the external role:
```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r roles/requirements.yml --roles-path roles
```

During development, if you have the role locally, create a symlink:
```bash
ln -snf ../ans_dev_sandbox_role roles/ans_dev_sandbox_role
```

## Getting Help

If you encounter an issue not covered here:

1. Check that your environment is activated: `source ACTIVATE_SANDBOX_ENV.bash`
2. Verify Python version: `python --version` (should be within >3.9 and <3.15)
3. Check for conflicting packages: `pip list | grep pytest`
4. Review logs: `cat ansible.log`
5. Run with verbose output: `molecule --debug verify -s default`

For plugin conflicts or package issues, recreate the virtual environment as described above.
